## Introduction

CDK Express Pipelines is a library that allows you to define your pipelines in CDK native method. It is built on
top of the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and is an alternative
to [AWS CDK Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/pipelines/)
that is build system agnostic.

Features:
- Works on any system for example your local machine, GitHub, GitLab, etc.
- Uses the `cdk deploy` command to deploy your stacks
- It's fast. Make use of concurrent/parallel Stack deployments
- Stages and Waves are plain classes, not constructs, they do not change nested Construct IDs (like CDK Pipelines)
- Supports TS and Python CDK

- [Exploring CI/CD with AWS CDK Express Pipeline: Faster and Efficient Deployments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pma4zP7mhMU)
  (YouTube channel [CI and CD on Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pma4zP7mhMU))
## How does it work?

This library makes use of the fact that the CDK CLI computes the dependency graph of your stacks and deploys them in
the correct order. It creates the correct dependency graph between Waves, Stages and Stacks with the help of the
native `.addDependency` method of the CDK Stack. The `cdk deploy '**'` command will deploy all stacks in the correct
order.

## Installation

### TS

```bash
npm install cdk-express-pipeline
```

Then import the library in your code:

```typescript
import { CdkExpressPipeline } from 'cdk-express-pipeline';
```

### Python

```bash
pip install cdk-express-pipeline
```

Then import the library in your code:

```python
from cdk_express_pipelines import CdkExpressPipeline
```

## Usage

The `ExpressStack` extends the `cdk.Stack` class and has a very similar signature, only taking an extra `stage`
parameter. There are multiple ways to build your pipeline, it involves creating the Pipeline, adding Waves, Stages and
Stacks to your Stages and then calling `.synth()` on the Pipeline. See the alternative expand sections for other
methods.

**Stack Definition:**

```typescript
  class StackA extends ExpressStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, stage: ExpressStage, stackProps?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, stage, stackProps);

    new cdk.aws_sns.Topic(this, 'MyTopic');
    // ... more resources
  }
}

class StackB extends ExpressStack {
  //... similar to StackA
}

class StackC extends ExpressStack {
  //... similar to StackA
}
```

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Pipeline Definition:**

```typescript
const app = new App();
const expressPipeline = new CdkExpressPipeline();

// === Wave 1 ===
const wave1 = expressPipeline.addWave('Wave1');
// --- Wave 1, Stage 1---
const wave1Stage1 = wave1.addStage('Stage1');

const stackA = new StackA(app, 'StackA', wave1Stage1);
const stackB = new StackB(app, 'StackB', wave1Stage1);
stackB.addExpressDependency(stackA);

// === Wave 2 ===
const wave2 = expressPipeline.addWave('Wave2');
// --- Wave 2, Stage 1---
const wave2Stage1 = wave2.addStage('Stage1');
new StackC(app, 'StackC', wave2Stage1);
expressPipeline.synth([
  wave1,
  wave2,
]);
```

The stack deployment order will be printed to the console when running `cdk` commands:

## Deployment Order

The Wave, Stage and Stack order is as follows:

- Waves are deployed sequentially, one after the other.
- Stages within a Wave are deployed in parallel by default, unless configured to be sequential.
- Stacks within a Stage are deployed in order of stack dependencies within a Stage.

For example, the following definition of Waves, Stages and Stacks as in CDK Express Pipelines:

![order.png](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline/blob/main/docs/_imgs/order-25smaller.png)

Will create a dependency graph as follows:

![img.png](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline/blob/main/docs/_imgs/order_dependencies-25smaller.png)

When used with `cdk deploy '**' --concurrency 10`, it will deploy all stacks in parallel, 10 at a time, where possible
while still adhering to the dependency graph. Stacks will be deployed in the following order:

### Console Output

The Deployment Order can be printed to the console when running the `pipeline.synth` function, it is enabled by default
but can be disabled in the function arguments. 

Let's use an example of a pipeline that features all possible display options:

<details>
<summary>Verbal explanation of the output</summary>

There are three waves. Waves run sequentially. Within each wave, stages run in parallel unless marked `[Seq üèó]`,
which only Wave3 is. Stacks in a stage deploy in the order based on their dependencies, shown with arrows (`‚Ü≥`),
and their position in the deployment order is indicated with square brackets like `[1]`.

Wave1 has two stages. In Stage1, StackA and StackF (shown by `[1]`) deploy first. StackB, StackC, and StackE (`[2]`)
follow, all depending on earlier stacks. StackD (`[3]`) is last, depending on StackB and StackF. Stage2 runs in
parallel and deploys StackA and StackB (`[1]`) first, followed by StackC (`[2]`), which depends on StackB.

Wave2 has two stages, all stacks (`[1]`) in both stages deploy at the same time since they have no dependencies.

Wave3 is marked `[Seq üèó]`, so its stages run one after another. Stage1 deploys StackL and StackM (`[1]`) at the same
time, and then Stage3 deploys StackN and StackO (`[1]`).

The stack selector is shown in parentheses next to each stack. For example, Wave1 Stage1 StackA has the selector 
`Wave1_Stage1_StackA`. Since every line begins with a pipe (`|`), we can infer that the command used was 
`cdk (diff|deploy) '**'`, meaning all stacks are targeted with this command. We could instead have targeted a specific
wave, stage or stack by using a command like `cdk (diff|deploy) 'Wave1_Stage1_*'`, which would only deploy the stacks
in Wave1 Stage1.

           - Lines prefixed with a pipe (|) indicate stacks matching the CDK pattern.
           - Stack deployment order within the stage is shown in square brackets (ex: [1])

|     üì¶ StackN (Wave3_Stage2_StackN) [1]
|     üì¶ StackO (Wave3_Stage2_StackO) [1]
```

### Mermaid Graph File Output

The Deployment Order can also be outputted to a markdown file containing a Mermaid graph. This option is **disabled** by
default, and can be enabled when running the `pipeline.synth`. The output defaults to the root of the project with the
filename `pipeline-deployment-order.md`, this too can be changed in the function arguments.

Let's use, the same example as above, of a pipeline that features all possible display options:

<details>

which only Wave3's stages are. Stacks in a stage deploy in the order based on their dependencies, shown with arrows,

    Wave0 --> Wave1
    Wave1 --> Wave2
```

## Options

### Separator
By default, the library uses an underscore (`_`) as the separator between Wave, Stage and Stack IDs. Not available in
the Legacy classes. This can be customized by passing a different separator to the `CdkExpressPipeline` constructor:

```typescript
const expressPipeline = new CdkExpressPipeline({
  separator: '-', // Now stack IDs will be like: Wave1-Stage1-StackA
});
```

### Sequential Stages
By default, stages within a wave are deployed in parallel. You can configure a wave to deploy its stages sequentially
by setting the `sequentialStages` option:

```typescript
const wave1 = expressPipeline.addWave('Wave1', {
  sequentialStages: true, // Stages in this wave will be deployed one after another
});
```

When a wave's stages are configured to be sequential, the wave will be marked with `[Seq üèóÔ∏è]` in the deployment order
output:

```plaintext
üåä Wave1 [Seq üèóÔ∏è]
  üèóÔ∏è Stage1
    üì¶ StackA (Wave1_Stage1_StackA) [1]
  üèóÔ∏è Stage2
    üì¶ StackB (Wave1_Stage2_StackB) [1]
```

## Selective Deployment

Leverages a consistent and predictable naming convention for Stack IDs. A Stack ID consists of the Wave, Stage and
original Stack ID. This enables us to target Waves, Stages or individual stacks for deployment. For example, given the
following stack IDs:

```
Wave1_Stage1_StackA
Wave1_Stage1_StackB
Wave1_Stage1_StackC
Wave1_Stage2_StackD

Wave2_Stage1_StackE
Wave2_Stage1_StackF
```

It makes targeted deployments easy:

- Deploy Wave1: `cdk deploy 'Wave1_*'` deploys all stacks in `Wave1`
- Deploy Wave1 Stage1: `cdk deploy 'Wave1_Stage1_*'` deploys all stacks in `Wave1_Stage1`
- Deploy Wave1 Stage1 StackA: `cdk deploy 'Wave1_Stage1_StackA'` deploys only `Wave1_Stage1_StackA`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When targeting specific stacks be sure to pass the `--exclusively` flag to the `cdk deploy` command to only deploy
> the specified stacks and not its dependencies.

Benefits of selecting a specific Wave, Stage or Stack over the all `'**'` method:

- While developing, you can speed up deployments from your local machine by deploying only what you are working on.
- When deploying with a CI/CD system, you can have additional logic between them. For example, you can place a
  manual approval step between `Wave1` and `Wave2`.

## Builds System Templates/Examples

### Local

These examples all assume a project created with the default structure of the CDK CLI
command `cdk init app --language typescript`.

These example are taken from the demo TS project: https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline-demo-ts

**Diff commands**

```bash
# Diffs all stacks
cdk diff '**' --profile YOUR_PROFILE
# Diffs only specific stacks in a Wave
cdk diff 'Wave1_*' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively
# Diffs only specific stacks of a Stage in a Wave
cdk diff 'Wave1_Stage1_*' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively
# Diffs only a specific stack
cdk diff 'Wave1_Stage1_StackA' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively
```

**Deploy commands**

```bash
# Deploys all stacks in correct order
cdk deploy '**' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --concurrency 10 --require-approval never
# Deploys only specific stacks in a Wave in correct order
cdk deploy 'Wave1_*' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively --concurrency 10 --require-approval never
# Deploys only specific stacks of a Stage in a Wave in correct order
cdk deploy 'Wave1_Stage1_*' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively --concurrency 10 --require-approval never
# Deploys only a specific stack
cdk deploy 'Wave1_Stage1_StackA' --profile YOUR_PROFILE --exclusively --concurrency 10 --require-approval never

The `synth` job builds the CDK app and saves the cloud assembly to the `./cloud_assembly_output` directory. The whole
repo with installed NPM packages and the cloud assembly is then cached. This job of the pipeline does not have access
to any AWS Secrets, the installing of packages and building is decoupled from the deployment improving security.

The `wave1` and `wave2` jobs fetches the cloud assembly from the cache and then does a CDK Diff and Deploy on only their
stacks. The `wave1` job targets all the stacks that start with `Wave1_` and the `wave2` job targets all the stacks that
start with `Wave2_`. It is important to add the `--exclusively` flag to only focus on the specified stacks and not its
dependencies.

## GitHub CI Workflow Generation

CDK Express Pipeline includes built-in GitHub CI workflow generation that automatically create GitHub
Actions workflows based on your pipeline configuration. This feature eliminates the need to manually write and maintain 
GitHub workflow files.

### Basic Usage

To generate GitHub workflows, you need to specify a `GitHubWorkflowConfig` object when calling the
`generateGitHubWorkflows` method on your `CdkExpressPipeline` instance. This configuration defines how the workflows 
should be structured, including build, synth, diff, and deploy commands.

This basic example assumes that you only have one environment/AWS account named `prod`. A CDK diff will be created on pull request 
to the `main` branch, and a CDK deploy will be created on push action to the `main` branch. You can customize the 
configuration to suit your needs, including multiple environments, custom build processes, and more.

```typescript
import { CdkExpressPipeline, GitHubWorkflowConfig } from 'cdk-express-pipeline';

// Define your pipeline (as shown in Usage section)
const app = new App();
const pipeline = new CdkExpressPipeline();
// ... add waves, stages, and stacks ...

// Define GitHub workflow configuration
const ghConfig: GitHubWorkflowConfig = {
  synth: {
    buildConfig: {
      type: 'preset-npm', // or 'workflow' to specify a GitHub workflow file for custom build process
    },
    commands: [
      { prod: "npm run cdk -- synth '**'" },
    ],
  },
  diff: [{
    on: {
      pullRequest: {
        branches: ['main'],
      },
    },
    stackSelector: 'stage',
    writeAsComment: true,
    assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
    assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
    commands: [
      { prod: 'npm run cdk -- diff {stackSelector}' },
    ],
  }],
  deploy: [{
    on: {
      push: {
        branches: ['main'],
      },
    },
    stackSelector: 'stage',
    assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
    assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
    commands: [
      { prod: 'npm run cdk -- deploy {stackSelector} --concurrency 10 --require-approval never --exclusively' },
    ],
  }],
};

// Generate workflows and save them (by specifying the `true` argument) 
await pipeline.generateGitHubWorkflows(ghConfig, true);
```

The workflow generation creates the following files in your `.github` directory:

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-synth/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-diff/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-deploy/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-diff.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-deploy-prod.yml
```

### Configuration Options

#### Synth Configuration

The `synth` configuration defines how your CDK application is built and synthesized:

```typescript
synth: {
  buildConfig: {
    type: 'preset-npm', // Built-in npm build process
    // OR
    type: 'workflow',
    workflow: {
      path: '.github/actions/build', // Path to custom workflow
    },
  },
  commands: [
    { prod: "npm run cdk -- synth '**'" },
  ],
}
```

The `buildConfig` can use a built-in preset (like `preset-npm`) which uses the standard NPM build process GitHub 
Action steps, installing node and then npm install. Alternatively, you can specify a **reusable action** that defines a
custom workflow in native GitHub Actions format, allowing for a more complex build processes. Like building 
assets in parallel, pushing to container registries etc. For example:

```yaml
# .github/actions/build/action.yml
name: Custom Build
description: Only needed if Synth build step is set to 'workflow'. When able, use the `preset-` instead
runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - name: Set up node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: npm
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      shell: bash
    
    # Additional steps to build Applications that are referenced in the CDK app
```

The `commands` array defines the commands to run for synthesizing your CDK application. This allows you to generate 
multiple CDK cloud assemblies for different environments (e.g., dev, prod) by using environment-specific commands.

This example assumes this is done with `env` [CDK context variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html#context-cli) 
and shows how to generate two different cloud assemblies for `dev` and `prod` environments and store there output in
separate directories within the `cdk.out` directory. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These commands must still place these cloud assemblies in the `cdk.out` directory. The `cdk.out` and `node_modules` 
> will be cached and restored on workflow jobs within diff and deploy.

```typescript
synth: {
  commands: [
    {dev: "npm run cdk -- synth '**' -c env=dev --output=cdk.out/dev"},
    {prod: "npm run cdk -- synth '**' -c env=prod --output=cdk.out/prod"},
  ]
}
```

#### Diff Configuration

The `diff` configuration defines when and how CDK diff operations are performed:

```typescript
diff: [{
  on: {
    pullRequest: {
      branches: ['main', 'develop'],
    },
    // OR
    push: {
      branches: ['main'],
    },
  },
  stackSelector: 'stage', // 'wave', 'stage', or 'stack'
  writeAsComment: true, // Write diff output as PR comment
  assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
  assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
  commands: [
    { prod: 'npm run cdk -- diff {stackSelector}' },
  ],
}]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These commands must include the {stackSelector} string that gets replaced dynamically.

The `on` field specifies the events that trigger the diff operation, you would most likely always want to trigger this
on pull requests. The `writeAsComment` property uses the [corymhall/cdk-diff-action@v2](https://github.com/corymhall/cdk-diff-action)
Action to write the diff output as a comment on the pull request. This is useful for reviewing changes before merging.

See the [Stack Selectors](#stack-selectors) section below for details on the `stackSelector` option. The `assumeRoleArn`
and `assumeRegion` options are used to configure the [AWS OIDC authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
for the GitHub Actions workflow, allowing it to assume a role in your AWS account securely when doing `commands`.

#### Deploy Configuration

The `deploy` configuration defines when and how CDK deploy operations are performed:

```typescript
deploy: [{
  on: {
    pullRequest: {
      branches: ['main'],
    },
  },
  stackSelector: 'stack', // 'wave', 'stage', or 'stack'
  assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
  assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
  commands: [
    { prod: 'npm run cdk -- deploy {stackSelector} --concurrency 10 --require-approval never --exclusively' },
  ],
}]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These commands must include the {stackSelector} string that gets replaced dynamically.

The `on` field specifies the events that trigger the deploy operation, you would most likely always want to trigger this
on pushes or on tag creation.

See the [Stack Selectors](#stack-selectors) section below for details on the `stackSelector` option. The `assumeRoleArn`
and `assumeRegion` options are used to configure the [AWS OIDC authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
for the GitHub Actions workflow, allowing it to assume a role in your AWS account securely when doing the `commands`.

### Stack Selectors

The `stackSelector` option determines how stacks are targeted in diff and deploy operations:

- **`'wave'`**: Will create a GitHun Job in the Workflow for each wave (e.g., `Wave1_*`)
- **`'stage'`**: Will create a GitHun Job in the Workflow for each wave and stage combination (e.g., `Wave1_Stage1_*`)
- **`'stack'`**: Will create a GitHun Job in the Workflow for each wave, stage and stack combination (e.g., `Wave1_Stage1_Stack1`)

The `{stackSelector}` placeholder in commands is automatically replaced with the appropriate pattern as shown above.

Using `stack` is the most granular, but it will spawn a separate job for each stack, which may not be ideal for larger
pipelines as this adds a bit of overhead. Each job needs to fetch the `cdk.out` (cloud assembly) and `node_modules` from the 
cache, which can additional time, and thus cost. This might become an issue in pipelines with large assets and many stacks. 

Recommended defaults: 
- `diff` config: `'stage'` is a good balance between granularity and performance as each job will post a GitHub comment
  if `writeAsComment` is set to `true`.
- `deploy` config: `'stack'` is recommended so that each job only shows the CFN deployment logs for that stack and the 
  job can be retried if it fails without affecting other stacks.

### Advanced Features

#### Multiple Environments

Both `diff` and `deploy` configurations accept arrays. This allows you to define multiple workflows for different 
environments or deployment strategies.

This example:
- Assumes that the `main` branch is linked to the `development` AWS environment/account and the `prod` branch is linked
 to the `production` environment.
- Do both `staging` and `production` diffs on PRs to the `main` branch. So that we can also see the changes that will
 be deployed to production when making this PR to staging.
- Do a `production` diff on PRs to the `production` branch.
- Defines separate deploy workflows for `development` and `production` when pushing to the `main` and `production`
 branches, respectively.

```typescript
const ghConfig: GitHubWorkflowConfig = {
 synth: {
   buildConfig: {
     type: 'preset-npm',
   },
   commands: [
     { development: "npm run cdk -- synth '**' -c env=development --output=cdk.out/development" },
     { production: "npm run cdk -- synth '**' -c env=production --output=cdk.out/production" },
   ],
 },
 diff: [
   {
     id: 'development',
     on: {
       pullRequest: {
         branches: ['main'],
       },
     },
     stackSelector: 'stage',
     writeAsComment: true,
     assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
     assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
     commands: [
       { development: 'npm run cdk -- diff {stackSelector} --app=cdk.out/development' },
       { production: 'npm run cdk -- diff {stackSelector} --app=cdk.out/production' },
     ],
   },
   {
     id: 'production',
     on: {
       pullRequest: {
         branches: ['production'],
       },
     },
     stackSelector: 'stage',
     writeAsComment: true,
     assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
     assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
     commands: [
       { production: 'npm run cdk -- diff {stackSelector} --app=cdk.out/production' },
     ],
   },
 ],
 deploy: [
   {
     id: 'development',
     on: {
       push: {
         branches: ['main'],
       },
     },
     stackSelector: 'stack',
     assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
     assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
     commands: [
       { development: 'npm run cdk -- deploy {stackSelector} --concurrency 10 --require-approval never --exclusively --app=cdk.out/development' },
     ],
   },
   {
     id: 'production',
     on: {
       push: {
         branches: ['production'],
       },
     },
     stackSelector: 'stack',
     assumeRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-oidc-role',
     assumeRegion: 'us-east-1',
     commands: [
       { production: 'npm run cdk -- deploy {stackSelector} --concurrency 10 --require-approval never --exclusively --app=cdk.out/production' },
     ],
   },
 ],
}
```

The `ids` for the `diff` and `deploy` objects are used to generate unique workflow file names in the 
`.github/workflows` directory. For example, these files will be generated (along with the reusable actions in the 
`.github/actions` directory):

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-synth/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-diff/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-deploy/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-diff-development.yml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-diff-production.yml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-deploy-development.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-express-pipeline-deploy-production.yml
```

#### Workflow Customization

The generated workflows can be customized using JSON Patch operations:

```typescript
import { CdkExpressPipeline, GitHubWorkflowConfig } from 'cdk-express-pipeline';

// Define your pipeline (as shown in Usage section)
const app = new App();
const pipeline = new CdkExpressPipeline();
// ... add waves, stages, and stacks ...

// Define GitHub workflow configuration
const ghConfig: GitHubWorkflowConfig = {
  ...
};

const ghWorkflows = await pipeline.generateGitHubWorkflows(ghConfig, false);
for (let w = 0; w < ghWorkflows.length; w++) {
  if (ghWorkflows[w].fileName === 'workflows/cdk-express-pipeline-deploy-dev.yml') {
    ghWorkflows[w]?.content.patch(
      // Change the concurrency of the deploy dev workflow
      JsonPatch.replace('/concurrency/cancel-in-progress', true),
      //Add an extra step to the build job that echos success
      JsonPatch.add('/jobs/build/steps/-', {
        name: 'Echo Success',
        shell: 'bash',
        run: 'echo "Build succeeded!"',
      }),
    );
  }
}

pipeline.saveGitHubWorkflows(ghWorkflows);
```

The JSON object of the workflow can be modified using the `JsonPatch` class, which provides the following methods:
- `add(path, value)`: Adds a value to an object or inserts it into an array. In the case of an
  array, the value is inserted before the given index. The `-` character can be
  used instead of an index to insert at the end of an array. 
  Ex: `JsonPatch.add('/milk', true) JsonPatch.add('/biscuits/1', { "name": "Ginger Nut" })`
- `remove(path)`: Removes a value from an object or array. 
  Ex: `JsonPatch.remove('/biscuits') JsonPatch.remove('/biscuits/0')`
- `replace(path, value)`: Replaces a value. Equivalent to a ‚Äúremove‚Äù followed by an ‚Äúadd‚Äù. 
  Ex: `JsonPatch.replace('/biscuits/0/name', 'Chocolate Digestive')`
- `copy(from, path)`: Copies a value from one location to another within the JSON document. Both
  from and path are JSON Pointers.
  Ex: `JsonPatch.copy('/biscuits/0', '/best_biscuit')`
- `move(from, path)`: Moves a value from one location to the other. Both from and path are JSON Pointers.
  Ex: `JsonPatch.move('/biscuits', '/cookies')`
- `test(path, value)`: Tests that the specified value is set in the document. If the test fails,
  then the patch as a whole should not apply.
  Ex: `JsonPatch.test('/best_biscuit/name', 'Choco Leibniz')`

## Legacy Usage

The `CdkExpressPipelineLegacy` class can be used when you do not want/can not use the `ExpressStack` class and have to
stick to the CDK `Stack` class.

> [!WARNING]
> Always use non-legacy classes for greenfield projects. Only use the Legacy classes if you have no other choice.

The following features are not available when using the Legacy classes:

- Enforcing Wave, Stage and Stack names do not include the `separator` character.
- Enforcing that a Stack in Stage 1 can not depend on a Stack in Stage 2.
- Printing stack dependencies within a Stage. Since we do not know what stage a stack belongs to, it's not possible to
  print the dependencies of stacks of only that stage and not others.
- If a consistent naming convention has not been followed for Stacks, it might not be possible to target all stacks in a
  stage or a wave. Deployment will have to always target all stacks with `"**"`.
- Stack ids are not changed and have to be unique across all stacks in the CDK app, whereas with the non-legacy
  classes, stack ids only have to be unique within a Wave.

**Stack Definition:**

```typescript
class StackA extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new cdk.aws_sns.Topic(this, 'MyTopicA');
    // ... more resources
  }
}

class StackB extends cdk.Stack {
  // ... similar to StackA
}

class StackC extends cdk.Stack {

}
```

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Pipeline Definition:**

```typescript
const app = new App();
const expressPipeline = new CdkExpressPipelineLegacy();

/* === Wave 1 === */
/* --- Wave 1, Stage 1--- */
const stackA = new StackA(app, 'StackA');
const stackB = new StackB(app, 'StackB');
stackB.addDependency(stackA);

// === Wave 2 ===
/* --- Wave 2, Stage 1--- */
const stackC = new StackC(app, 'StackC');

expressPipeline.synth([
  {
    id: 'Wave1',
    stages: [{
      id: 'Stage1',
      stacks: [
        stackA,
        stackB,
      ],
    }],
  },
  {
    id: 'Wave2',
    stages: [{
      id: 'Stage1',
      stacks: [
        stackC,
      ],
    }],
  },
]);
```

The stack deployment order will be printed to the console when running `cdk` commands:

```plaintext
ORDER OF DEPLOYMENT
üåä Waves  - Deployed sequentially.
üèóÔ∏è Stages - Deployed in parallel by default, unless the wave is marked `[Seq üèóÔ∏è]` for sequential stage execution.
üì¶ Stacks - Deployed after their dependent stacks within the stage (dependencies shown below them with ‚Ü≥).
           - Lines prefixed with a pipe (|) indicate stacks matching the CDK pattern.
           - Stack deployment order within the stage is shown in square brackets (ex: [1])

üåä Wave1
  üèóÔ∏è Stage1
    üì¶ StackA 
    üì¶ StackB
üåä Wave2
  üèóÔ∏è Stage1
    üì¶ StackC
```
